# 666generator

[666generator.com](https://666generator.com) is a joke website that tries to find a way to derive the number 666 out of
any given string.

# DISCLAIMER

This website was done in a single afternoon and therefore the code isn't really up to standard (in other words: bad). But because I was asked multiple times how it works, I decided to open-source it regardless.
